# COVID_19_Machine_learning
In the landscape of healthcare, data science is imperative in guiding pivotal public health decisions, optimizing resource allocation, and establishing tangible avenues. This project aims to contribute to 
these objectives by embarking on a comprehensive exploration of a dataset through data cleaning, preprocessing, and compelling visualizations. Following this initial step, the project delves into the realm 
of machine learning to predict COVID-19 deaths, employing a spectrum of models ranging from classic linear regression to advanced deep learning models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated 
Recurrent Unit). To assess the efficacy of the models, a comprehensive set of metrics, including RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), and $R^2$ (Variance), is employed. 
This approach facilitates a thorough comparison of model quality, allowing for informed insights into the predictive capabilities of each model. The outcomes of this research contribute to the broader 
understanding of the applicability of data science in healthcare, especially in the context of forecasting and managing the dynamics of a complex public health crisis like COVID-19.
